This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [@wagmi/cli](https://wagmi.sh/cli) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi)

# Getting Started

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

This command will also generate React Hooks from the Wagmi Mint Example Etherscan contract (e.g. `useWagmiMintExampleTotalSupply`, `useWagmiMintExampleBalanceOf`, etc) for you to use in your project.

Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/pages/index.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.
